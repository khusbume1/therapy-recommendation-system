# therapy-recommendation-system
This therapy recommendation system is developed using the concept of collaborative filtering that is used by Netflix and Amazon to recommend movies and products to the customers. This concept is used in the health care application. For the patients who are suffering from autoimmune disease or some chronic diseases, modern medicines called allopathic are not useful after some point and they have to look for alternative medicines. While looking for alternative medicines there are a number of options that the patient has to try on their own each and find out which one would work for them. I have tried to solve this problem by finding out the patients which are similar to each other in terms of age, sex, disease severity and their prior reaction to the therapies they have already used. On the basis of these similarity using cosine similarity and the rating provided by other patients, the patient gets a therapy recommended for him/her as the patient can refer.
